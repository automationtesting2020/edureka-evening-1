When you are working first time in GIT

1) Create a file with name akshat.txt 
with content hi i am akshat

touch akshat.txt

2) git init   #initialize the git 

3) git status   

4) git add .  # add this file akshat.txt in the staging area 

5) git status #you will see akshat.txt is in green color which means it is in staging area

6) git rm --cached akshat.txt   #put back the file from the staging area to the WD again 

7) git status   #you will see that akshat.txt is in red color which means in the WD

8) git add .   # again adding the file akshat.txt to the staging area 

9)  Make some change in the content of akshat.txt file. lets say add a new line i am teaching

git diff akshat.txt  #you will see the line which is updated 

10) git add . 

11) git config --global user.name "akshatgupta07"

12) git config --global user.email "akshu20791@gmail.com"

13) git config --list | grep user.name

14) git config --list | grep user.email 

#grep command is used to search the matching pattern ...like ctrl f in ms word

15) git commit -m"created akshat.txt file"  ## save the file as version 

16) git log   #show all the commits

17) git log --oneline #show commits in one line

18) create a account on github and create a repo on github.com

19) git remote add origin <<repo link>>

20) git push -u origin master 

It will ask for authentication
if it is not showing authentication then go to window credential manager and remove user name and passworf for git hun[see recording video of that]
go to github.com (login) and in new tab open https://github.com/settings/tokens -> generate token 

copy paste the token

you will see the github repo updated
